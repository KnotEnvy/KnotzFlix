## Agent Update ‚Äì 2025-09

This section captures recent changes and conventions to align future agents.

### Status Deltas
- Single-instance focus IPC: Implemented. Second launch pings the running app over localhost and brings the window to front.
- Instant search UI: Implemented in Library tab. Uses FTS5 when available with safe tokenization; falls back to LIKE.
- Posters heuristic: Improved. Prefers ffmpeg `thumbnail`; then scores deterministic candidate timestamps via `signalstats`/`edgedetect`; falls back to placeholder if needed.
- Details view: Implemented minimal dialog (poster, title/year, basic badges, Play/Open Folder).
- Shelves: Added tabs for Recently Added and By Folder (filters by selected root).
- Locate Missing flow: Context menu action to relink a missing file path.
- Watchers: Added lightweight polling fallback (QTimer) and optional native watchers via `watchdog` if installed.
- Toasts: Non-blocking toast widget added; used for Library actions.
- Validate Posters: One-click fixer in Settings; ffmpeg status indicator.

### Key Implementation Notes
- Threading/SQLite: Never share a `sqlite3.Connection` across threads. `ui.main_window.ScanWorker` opens a thread-local `Database` inside `run()`.
- FTS5 queries: Use `Database.search_titles(query)` which tokenizes input and builds a `token*` prefix query. Do not pass raw user strings to FTS5.
- Posters rendering: `PosterTileDelegate` draws a gradient using `QLinearGradient` with float coords. If a pixmap fails to load, a clear placeholder tile is rendered.
- Thumbnails pipeline: `infra/thumbnails.generate_poster` prefers `thumbnail` filter; dry-run returns a timestamp-based command to keep tests deterministic.
- Per-root rescans: Settings tab includes Remove Selected and Rescan Selected buttons. UI wires to the existing scan pipeline.

### Developer Shortcuts & UX
- Library grid shortcuts: `P` to Play, `R` to Reveal in file explorer. Double-click/Enter opens Details.
- Search debounce: 120 ms via QTimer. Tune as needed to meet ‚â§100 ms budget on large libraries.

### Tests & Validation
- Run tests: `python scripts/run_unittests.py` (31 tests passing at time of update).
- If you change thumbnails behavior, ensure `tests/test_thumbnails.py` expectations remain valid (dry-run returns a timestamp-based ffmpeg command containing `-ss` and `-vf`).

### Open Items (PRD/Checklist)
- Poster golden tests + deterministic seed for heuristic selection.
- Grid keyboard polish (PgUp/PgDn/Home/End selection by viewport rows/cols).
- Continue Watching shelf using `play_state` and progress badges.
- Real FS watchers (inotify/FSEvents/USN) with the polling fallback retained as a safety net.
- Packaging and first-run wizard.

### Gotchas
- JPEG warnings from Qt for some files are benign; ensure the delegate handles null pixmaps. Consider self-healing (swap to placeholder) if you see frequent decode failures.
- Keep DB migrations idempotent and FTS5 guarded; environments may lack FTS5.

## Project Snapshot
- Goal: Local‚Äëfirst, offline Netflix‚Äëstyle movie manager.
- Stack: Python 3.11+, PyQt6 (MVVM), SQLite + FTS5, ffmpeg/ffprobe.
- Repo layout: `ui/`, `domain/`, `infra/`, `tests/`.
- Status: Backend foundations, DB, scanning, parsing, hashing, posters cache, focus IPC, instant search, Library/Recently Added/By Folder/Continue Watching tabs, Details dialog, and Locate Missing are in. Tests passing.

## What‚Äôs Implemented
- Foundations
  - Data dirs (per‚ÄëOS) + `KNOTZFLIX_DATA_DIR` override for tests.
  - Rotating logs; JSON config persisted as `settings.json`.
  - Single‚Äëinstance lock (file lock) + focus IPC via localhost.
- Database
  - Migrations: v1 (core tables) + v2 (media metadata columns). FTS5 triggers keep index in sync.
  - CRUD + helpers (get by title/year, upsert media files, search, relink by path, images API).
- Scanner & Parser
  - Recursive scan, ignore rules (hidden, `Extras/`, `sample.*`), concurrency, progress callback.
  - Filename parser with 90%+ accuracy corpus test; `sort_title` rules.
- Media Probe & Hashing
  - `ffprobe` JSON parser and safe probe wrapper (optional if executable missing).
  - Partial fingerprint via blake2b (dependency‚Äëfree). Duplicate grouping and rename relink implemented.
- Posters/Cache
  - Content‚Äëaddressed cache with sharded paths; idempotent reuse.
  - Poster generator (ffmpeg if available; otherwise valid 1√ó1 PNG placeholder). Deterministic timestamp candidates + scoring.
- Playback & File Handling
  - Cross‚Äëplatform launch/default player commands and ‚Äúopen containing folder‚Äù (infra level).
- UI (early)
  - App shell with tabs: Library (poster grid with instant search), Recently Added, By Folder, Continue Watching, Settings.
  - Threaded scan with responsive progress bar; summary message; toasts for common actions; Library grids refresh.

## What‚Äôs Not Done (or Partial)
- Posters heuristic: advanced luminance/edge heuristics still to implement (currently thumbnail filter + timestamp fallback).
- UI grid polish: virtualization sizing, focus ring styling, and performance validation targets.
- Continue Watching: refine progress updates beyond initial seeding on Play.
- Real FS watchers: inotify/FSEvents/USN via native APIs; `watchdog` optional support added; polling fallback exists.
- Packaging/first‚Äërun wizard and QA hardening.

## How to Run
- Tests (recommended): `python scripts/run_unittests.py`
- App (requires PyQt6):
  - Install: `pip install PyQt6` (inside your venv)
  - Run: `python scripts/run_app.py`
- Lint/Format (if tools available): `ruff check .` and `black --check .`

## Data & Paths
- Default user data dir depends on OS; override with `KNOTZFLIX_DATA_DIR` to use a temp directory.
- Files created: `db.sqlite3`, `settings.json`, `logs/knotzflix.log`, `cache/` (posters).

## Key Modules
- `infra/paths.py`: app data/log/cache paths.
- `infra/logging_config.py`: root logger with rotation.
- `infra/config.py`: `AppConfig` (roots, concurrency, ignore rules) + load/save.
- `infra/single_instance.py`: lock file guard.
- `infra/db.py`: migrations, CRUD, search, images, relink helpers.
- `infra/scanner.py`: recursive scanning, filters, concurrency.
- `infra/parser.py`: filename ‚Üí title/year + `sort_title`.
- `infra/fingerprinter.py`: partial blake2b fingerprint.
- `infra/ffprobe.py`: safe probe + JSON parse to `MediaInfo`.
- `infra/cache.py`: content‚Äëaddressed cache utils.
- `infra/thumbnails.py`: poster generation (ffmpeg or placeholder), scoring, cache integration, ffmpeg status.
- `infra/library_service.py`: end‚Äëto‚Äëend scan ‚Üí index ‚Üí dupes/rename ‚Üí probe ‚Üí poster.
- `infra/playback.py`: external player launch + reveal in OS file explorer.
- `infra/ipc_focus.py`: localhost-based single-instance window focus IPC.
- `infra/watcher.py`: optional native watchers via watchdog; used with UI debounce.
- `ui/app.py`: app entry + single‚Äëinstance guard.
- `ui/main_window.py`: tabs, folder chooser, rescan, progress.
- `ui/models/movie_list_model.py`: list model for movies with poster decoration.
- `ui/views/poster_grid.py`: grid view with poster rendering, context actions.
- `ui/widgets/toast.py`: non-blocking toasts.

## Tests
- `tests/*` cover: paths/config/logging, DB CRUD/indexing, scanner/parser, fingerprinter, library service flows (dupes, rename, poster creation), ffprobe parsing, and playback commands.
- Run all: `python scripts/run_unittests.py`

## Immediate Next Steps (recommended)
1) Poster heuristics v2: implement brightness/edge scoring via ffmpeg signalstats/metadata on the deterministic candidate set; add golden tests for scoring fallbacks.
2) Grid performance + keyboard polish: verify ‚â§200ms first render, scroll smoothness, focus ring; refine PageUp/Down behavior by viewport rows/cols.
3) Continue Watching: wire progress updates on external playback handoff; refine progress badges.
4) Real FS watchers: add inotify/FSEvents/USN with opt-in and keep polling fallback.
5) First-run wizard + packaging: streamline onboarding and produce installers.

## Notes & Decisions
- Fingerprint hashing uses blake2b for now to avoid extra deps; easily swappable to BLAKE3 later.
- Posters are cached content‚Äëaddressed; reusing across rescans is in place.
- ffprobe/ffmpeg are optional; code paths gracefully fallback if not present.
- UI is structured for MVVM growth; current grid is a pragmatic list‚Äëmodel starting point.

## Troubleshooting
- Tests failing due to path imports: ensure project root on `sys.path` or run via `scripts/run_unittests.py`.
- Windows `python -c` quoting in PowerShell: prefer using scripts to avoid quoting pitfalls.
- Posters: Check Settings for ffmpeg status; use ‚ÄúValidate Posters‚Äù to regenerate missing/placeholder posters; logs show failures.

## PRD & Checklist
- Authoritative plan lives in `DOCS/PRD.md` and `DOCS/DevChecklist.md`.
- `DOCS/DevChecklist.md` is updated to current status with notes on partial items.

Happy hacking ‚Äî and thank you for picking up KnotzFLix! üöÄ
