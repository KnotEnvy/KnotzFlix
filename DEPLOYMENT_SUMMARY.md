# KnotzFLix - Production Deployment Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT STATUS: PRODUCTION READY

### Final Build Information
- **Executable**: `dist/knotzflix/knotzflix.exe` (89MB total distribution)
- **Build Date**: September 13, 2025
- **Tests**: âœ… All 33 tests passing
- **Packaging**: âœ… PyInstaller build successful

### What We Accomplished
1. **âœ… Fixed PyInstaller build script** - Now properly handles module installation
2. **âœ… Fixed ruff configuration** - Removed unsupported format section for older ruff version
3. **âœ… Auto-fixed code quality issues** - Reduced lint issues significantly
4. **âœ… Verified all tests pass** - Complete test suite validation
5. **âœ… Created production documentation** - CLAUDE.md and deployment guides

### Build Commands for Production
```bash
# Build production executable
python scripts/build_pyinstaller.py

# Run full test suite
python scripts/run_unittests.py

# Code quality check
ruff check . --fix
```

### Distribution Package
The complete application is in `dist/knotzflix/` containing:
- `knotzflix.exe` - Main executable (2.4MB)
- Python runtime and dependencies (~87MB total)
- PyQt6 UI libraries
- SQLite database support
- All required DLLs

### Deployment Instructions
1. **Package**: Zip the entire `dist/knotzflix/` folder
2. **Distribute**: Send zip file to users
3. **Install**: Users extract and run `knotzflix.exe` directly
4. **FFmpeg**: Users should install FFmpeg separately for poster generation

### User Setup Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- No Python installation required (self-contained)
- FFmpeg recommended for poster generation (optional)
- ~100MB disk space for application
- Additional space for movie library database and posters

### Features Included in Production Build
- âœ… Movie library scanning and indexing
- âœ… Fast SQLite FTS5 search
- âœ… Automatic poster generation (with FFmpeg)
- âœ… Netflix-style UI with grid view
- âœ… Recently Added and Continue Watching shelves
- âœ… Private library with password protection
- âœ… External player integration
- âœ… File system watching for automatic updates
- âœ… Comprehensive settings and validation tools

### Known Limitations
- FFmpeg must be installed separately by users
- Windows-only build (macOS/Linux require separate builds)
- ~90MB distribution size due to PyQt6 and Python runtime

### Next Steps for Enhanced Distribution
1. Create Windows installer with Inno Setup or similar
2. Add code signing certificate for trusted execution
3. Build macOS and Linux versions using same script
4. Consider including FFmpeg in distribution package
